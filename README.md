# PicCap - Hyperion Sender App | Ambilight for LG WebOS TVs  

# NV12 control box added
  
## What's this?

### PicCap?    
PicCap is an frontend app, which you can install on your TV, to make TV content capturing as easy as possible. It ships and controls the seperated [hyperion-webos](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos) background native service, which uses capture interfaces on your TV based on reverse engineering, proccesses the output and sends as result a low quality image to a receiver like Hyperion's flatbuffer server.  
On newer TVs there is no official way for capturing DRM-protected content like from Netflix or Amazon. This restriction doesn't take place for content comming from an HDMI input.  
So currently as a workaround you can play your media using your PC, FireTV-Stick or Chromecast and still enjoy your LEDs.

### Hyperion?  
[hyperion.ng](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) basicly is a server service, which transforms incomming image data to an LED output. The idea is to have an ambilight like it's known from Philipps TVs.
It is used in DIY-environments, like builded up in [this tutorial](https://github.com/TBSniller/piccap/blob/main/docs/DIY_Ambilight.md).  
You can also run [Hyperion.ng webOS loader](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion.ng-webos-loader) or it's fork [HyperHDR webOS loader](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperhdr-webos-loader) directly on your webOS TV, so you don't need any further hardware, expect of your LED driver. Both apps can be found in [Homebrew Channels app repository](https://repo.webosbrew.org/apps/).

## How to install  

### What do you need?  
- [Root access](https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io) to your TV  
- webOS 3.4 or above  
- Latest version of [Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel) installed, as we take use of its elevate-service script  
- Brain with some basic knowledge - We haven't encountered any bricks, but standard no warranty clause applies

### Easy way
Open Homebrew Channel and install PicCap directly from there.  
  
### Manual way
First you will have to [build](https://github.com/TBSniller/piccap#development) it from scratch, or download pre-compiled IPK from [releases](https://github.com/TBSniller/piccap/releases).  
  
```
# Copy IPK to TV 
scp /home/[USER]/downloads/org.webosbrew.piccap_[version]_all.ipk root@[TVIP]:/tmp/org.webosbrew.piccap_[version]_all.ipk

# On TV install IPK
luna-send -i -f luna://com.webos.appInstallService/dev/install '{"id":"org.webosbrew.piccap","ipkUrl":"/tmp/org.webosbrew.piccap_[version]_all.ipk","subscribe":true}'
```
  
## How to use
### First start  
Wait a few secounds to let the service elevate root permissions through Homebrew Channel-Service. Check status message in bottom right corner, to see when it's done.
  
  
### Settings 
 - If you use hyperion.ng or HyperHDR loader, you will have to fill `127.0.0.1` as IP address. 
 - Change priority if you have other capture or effect sources for your Hyperion or HyperHDR instance.  

### Backends
We use different libraries to capture TVs content. These are used by hyperion-webos and described [here](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/tree/main#backends).  

### Advanced settings
Some TV models are comptabile with a specific backend, but require a slightly different routine to work reliably. You can find an explaination for  these so called quirks [here](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/tree/main#quirks).

## Development
### Dependencies
To build PicCap and hyperion-webos you will need:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
- [buildroot-nc4](https://github.com/openlgtv/buildroot-nc4)  

You will also need `clang-format-14` if you want to contribute.  

### How to build  
We have tried to make build proccess as easy as possible. After building all files can be found in `./build`.
```
# Setup buildroot-nc4 (needed for hyperion-webos)
cd /desired/path
wget -O toolchain.tar.gz $TOOLCHAIN_URL_FROM_RELEASES
tar -xvzf toolchain.tar.gz
rm toolchain.tar.gz
arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot/relocate-sdk.sh
export CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/desired/path/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot/share/buildroot/toolchainfile.cmake

# Clone project and submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TBSniller/piccap.git
cd ./piccap

# Install node dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run-script build-all        # Build PicCap & hyperion-webos + deps
npm run-script build-frontend   # Build PicCap only
npm run-script build-backend    # Build hyperion-webos + deps only

# Package IPK-file for TV installation
npm run-script package
```

### Known issues  
**Expect bugs - This app is still in early development**  
No issues are known so far, if you find one, feel free to raise an issue!  

Please see [hyperion-webos#known-issues](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/tree/main#known-issues) for issues regarding the backend service. - This only is the frontend application and has nothing to do with capture related things!  
Version tracker is available in [hyperion-webos#16](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/issues/16). 

### Credits
This project would never ever exists without help from [@Mariotaku](https://github.com/mariotaku) and [@Informatic](https://github.com/Informatic).
Both programmed important things at the beginning of this whole ambilight project. [@tuxuser](https://github.com/tuxuser) also made some important changes in the mid of this project.  
Share them some love if you can, they teached and showed me alot!
